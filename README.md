## Explainable Deep Learning Analysis: Understanding CNN Decision Patterns in MNIST Digit Classification
**Name: Afraa Noureen**

### 1. Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in the sensitivity patterns of digits 6 and 8 when analyzed through occlusion-based saliency mapping.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The sensitivity patterns of digits 6 and 8 differ, with digit 8 demonstrating increased sensitivity in specific regions.

### 2. Approach Overview
This assignment uses occlusion-based saliency mapping to analyze how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes and distinguishes between digits 6 and 8 in the MNIST dataset. The approach involves:

a. Training a custom CNN architecture on MNIST
b. Implementing occlusion saliency mapping
c. Analyzing regional sensitivity patterns
d. Statistical comparison of sensitivity distributions
